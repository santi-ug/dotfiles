# Practical neovim config

This is my personal neovim configuration, a pretty simple setup derived from neovim kickstart https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim.
This setup is updated for neovim 0.11.x and works fine for web development, python scripting, operating system development and much more.
